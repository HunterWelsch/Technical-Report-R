# Overview 

Completing applicable statistical tests for various vehicle data points. 

Goals:
* Perform ETL steps on data
* Create basic visualizations of the data (line, bar, box, and scatter plots)
* Create heatmaps when applicable 
* Design and interpret a multiple linear regression analysis to identify variables of interest.
* Calculate summary statistics for quantitative variables
* Determined if there is a significant relationship between mpg and vehicle_length, ground_clearance, vehicle_weight, and spoiler_angle.
* Determine if the suspension coilâ€™s pound-per-inch results are statistically different from the mean population results of 1,500 pounds per inch.
